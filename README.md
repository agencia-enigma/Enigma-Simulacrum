# Welcome to Enigma's website project!

Our ui design was created by [Coletivo Jupiter](https://www.behance.net/jupitercoletivo), and we are heavily focused on mobile first here. Hope you like it!

## About our stack
Our stack is basically composed by:

- Pure and semantic HTML;
- Stylus as CSS preprocessor;
- Vanilla JS;
- Gulp as task runner;

We pretend to implement some template engine and automated tests, but by now, it's just fit our needs.
